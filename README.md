## Project Description

The **Hajj & Umrah AI Assistant** is an AI-powered chatbot designed to assist pilgrims during their spiritual journey of Hajj and Umrah. The assistant combines **Large Language Models (LLMs)** with **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** to provide accurate, context-aware guidance on religious rituals, logistics, and spiritual preparation.

The project leverages **Lovable** for the web interface, offering a user-friendly platform for pilgrims to interact with the assistant. The system uses **LLMs** to generate conversational responses, while **RAG** ensures that answers are backed by authentic Islamic sources, providing both real-time guidance and support.

### Key Features:

- **Conversational AI**: The assistant can answer questions related to Hajj and Umrah rituals, travel logistics, health guidelines, and spiritual preparation.
- **Web Interface**: Built using **Lovable**, the interface is responsive and works on both mobile and desktop devices.
- **Real-time Document Retrieval**: The RAG system fetches information from a curated database to ensure accurate and up-to-date responses.
- **Context-Aware Responses**: The assistant adapts to the user's needs based on the conversation context, offering personalized guidance.

### Technical Overview:
- **Backend**: Powered by **Supabase**, which manages the database and ensures smooth data retrieval.
- **Frontend**: Designed with **Lovable** to create an intuitive, accessible user interface.
- **AI Integration**: The assistant utilizes **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** to provide accurate, context-aware responses by retrieving information from a curated knowledge base of Hajj and Umrah resources. This ensures that answers are both intelligent and grounded in authentic Islamic sources, providing pilgrims with relevant guidance.
